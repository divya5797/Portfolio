This is my personal portfolio website built using *HTML, CSS*.It is also responsive.
It showcases my profile, background, and interests, and serves as a way to connect with others.

- *Home*: Introduction and a short greeting.  
- *About*: Information about me, my education, and interests.  
- *Contact*: Ways to connect with me.  
- *Services*: A short overview of skills or areas of interest.  


 Technologies Used  
- *HTML5* for structure
